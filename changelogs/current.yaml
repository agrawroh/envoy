- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for per-route gRPC service override in the ``ext_authz`` HTTP filter. This allows different routes
    to use different external authorization backends by configuring a
    :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.CheckSettings.grpc_service>`
    in the per-route ``check_settings``. Routes without this configuration continue to use the default
    authorization service.
