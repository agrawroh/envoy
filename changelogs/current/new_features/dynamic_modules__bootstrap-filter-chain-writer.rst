Added a filter chain writer to the dynamic module bootstrap extension. It writes the filter chains
that the listeners with ``fcds_config`` find by name. Once a module calls
``envoy_dynamic_module_callback_bootstrap_extension_enable_filter_chain_writer``, it can add,
update and remove filter chains with
``envoy_dynamic_module_callback_bootstrap_extension_filter_chain_writer_add_or_update`` and
``envoy_dynamic_module_callback_bootstrap_extension_filter_chain_writer_remove``, and
``envoy_dynamic_module_on_bootstrap_extension_filter_chain_writer_update_done`` reports when each
write becomes active or why it failed. The Rust SDK exposes these as
``enable_filter_chain_writer``, ``filter_chain_writer_add_or_update`` and
``filter_chain_writer_remove`` of ``EnvoyBootstrapExtensionConfig`` and
``on_filter_chain_writer_update_done`` of ``BootstrapExtensionConfig``. See
:ref:`Filter Chain Writer <config_bootstrap_extensions_dynamic_modules_filter_chain_writer>`.
